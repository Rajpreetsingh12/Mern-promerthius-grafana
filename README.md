 # steps to deploy the travel memoey application on the aws ec2 #

The TravelMemory application has been developed using the MERN stack. 

Objective:
- Set up the backend running on Node.js.
- Configure the front end designed with React.
- Ensure efficient communication between the front end and back end.
- Deploy the full application on an EC2 instance.
- Facilitate load balancing by creating multiple instances of the application.
- Connect a custom domain through Cloudflare.

Project Repository:
Access the complete codebase of the TravelMemory application from the provided GitHub link: https://github.com/UnpredictablePrashant/TravelMemory

 Tasks:
1. Backend Configuration:
- Clone the repository and navigate to the backend directory.

    
    



-The backend runs on port 3001. Set up a reverse proxy using nginx to ensure smooth deployment on EC2. 

 

- Update the .env file to incorporate database connection details and port information.

 
2. Frontend and Backend Connection:

- Navigate to the `urls.js` in the frontend directory.
    


- Update the file to ensure the front end communicates effectively with the backend.
 
   
3. Scaling the Application:
- Create multiple instances of both the frontend and backend servers.
 

- Add these instances to a load balancer to ensure efficient distribution of incoming traffic.


4. Domain Setup with Cloudflare:
- Connect your custom domain to the application using Cloudflare.
-http://rajetraveljourney.maaan.org.in/ -hit this to access the backend of the applicatio	
- Create a CNAME record pointing to the load balancer endpoint.
- Set up an A record with the IP address of the EC2 instance hosting the front end.


 

- Designed a deployment architecture diagram using [draw.io](https://www.draw.io/) to visualize the flow and connections.
